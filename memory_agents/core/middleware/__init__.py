"""Middleware components for memory agents.

This module provides various middleware implementations for augmenting and retrieving
memories using Graphiti and vector database (VDB) systems. The middleware components
integrate with LangChain agents to provide memory capabilities.

The middleware classes handle:
- Memory augmentation (storing conversations)
- Memory retrieval (searching and context injection)
- Integration with Graphiti knowledge graphs
- Integration with ChromaDB vector storage
